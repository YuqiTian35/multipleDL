Title: Addressing Detection Limits by Cumulative Probability Models (CPMs)
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2022-04-28
Author: Yuqi Tian [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Chun Li <cli77199@usc.edu>
Description: Build CPMs (cumulative probability models, also known as cumulative link models) to account for detection limits (both single and multiple detection limits) in response variables. Conditional quantiles and conditional CDFs can be calculated based on fitted models.
